# TODO

This is best place i can think of to add my TODO list

## Features I want

- [This dev site](https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/) has a cool bookshelf page, where it looks like its hitting something like the goodreads API. They closed their API access so idk what i have to use instead, but its a cool idea.

- Can i hit some sort of google photos/apple/oura picture frame API to get pictures?
